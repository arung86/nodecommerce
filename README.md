# Nodecommerce

An full-featured, tested ecommerce API for node.

This code was written for an ecommerce mobile app, the app doesn't exist anymore, but the code remained... 

Nodecommerce is an express based ecommerce API which already includes:
* includes database migrations using the knex ORM
* integrated with the stripe payments API
* mocha and chai unit tests along with codecoverage with istanbul
* production grade logging with buynan
* secure user authentacation system using json web tokens 
* 

This system is not production ready! If you use it we are not responsible if anything goes wrong.
